#PickOn PHP Prototype
This is an prototype to demonstrate the PickOn concept. It is a self-contained system relying on manual configuration and manually adding student information. 

#Trying the prototype
- PHP V8 of higher must be installed
- In the PHP_Prototype directory start PHP using its built in server with document root to the test class directory. For example `php -S localhost:8080 -t TEST123` 
- If you do not have php installed, you may find installing a portable version in the local directory helpful [https://www.portalprogramas.com/en/php/]
