# PickOn
PickOn is a software in-the-making intended to increase student participation both online and in the classroom.

To run the PickOn software first install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download

Then in your terminal of choice download the express and express-sessions package. I use Git Bash so the command to complete this task is *npm install express* and *npm install express-sessions*

After the above task are completed make sure your in the PickOn directory then run node server.js in your terminal
