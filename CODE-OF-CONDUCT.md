# Contributor Code of Conduct


## Our Commitment

As individuals who are part of the pickOn community, we are dedicated to establishing an environment that embraces inclusivity and respect, ensuring that all individuals can engage without encountering harassment. This conduct code presents the principles and standards for everyone involved in the pickOn system, including developers, contributors, and users.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to adhere to the following behaviors, which contribute to a positive community environment:

Show empathy and kindness towards others.
Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
Provide and accept constructive feedback graciously.
Take responsibility for our actions and apologize to those affected by our mistakes, demonstrating a willingness to learn and grow.
Prioritize the well-being of the overall community, not just individual interests.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in our community:

Use of sexualized language or imagery, or making sexual advances of any kind.
Engaging in trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal and political attacks.
Harassment, whether public or private.
Publishing others' private information without explicit permission, including physical or email addresses.
Any conduct that could reasonably be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsible Use of the System

Use the pickOn system in a responsible and ethical manner. Do not engage in any activity that may disrupt or compromise the functioning of the system or negatively impact other users' experience. Comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and policies when using the pickOn system. Respect copyright, intellectual property rights, and licenses associated with the software and its components.


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders have the responsibility to clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will provide reasons for moderation decisions when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including online and offline interactions, and extends to situations where an individual represents the community publicly. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting through official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at events.

## Reportinging Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. They can be reached at dport@hawaii.du.

## Amendment and Updates

This code of conduct may be updated or modified as needed. Changes will be communicated to the community through appropriate channels. Users are expected to stay informed about the current version of the code of conduct and comply with its provisions.
